## Decentralized pet sitting/onboarding system

The idea of this project is to build an escrow and reputation platform for pet sitting, dog walking or different pet boarding options for those people who don't know what to do with their pets while on vacation, business trip or any other situation.
The platform will have a registration process for different services options. Individuals, professional pet sitters and businesses can register as service providers in a DApp.
The service providers need to buy and hold/lock tokens to get access to the platform and be listed. The token of the platform will be used as an insurance fund and to incentivize good behavior and a healthy community.
The Dapp of the platform will provide a way to allow communication between the parties to coordinate and arrange any details before contracting the service. Once there is a common agreement the chat is hashed and the transactions is recorded in the contract with the conditions/options and the user pays the total service cost.

The MVP of the platform is to create a Dapp that communicate with smart contracts to provide a secure escrow process and a reputation system with only one service option. 

The basic workflow is:

	1. Users signup as service providers in the platform and lock their tokens to be listed in the system.
	2. Client search for service in its area, signs an agreement with the service provider and pay the total cost of the service which is held securely by the smart contract. 
	3. Once the service begins the funds will be released everyday up to 50% of service cost. Once the service has finished the client gives feedback and release the other 50%.
	4. Alternatives workflows could occur like a dispute. In case of dispute the system select a high reputation user at random to help to solve the dispute and receive tokens as an incentive to participate.
	
	
Purpose and benefits

	1. Create an ecosystem of trust to help people find the perfect match to take care of their pet.
	2. We have a system with real feedback backed by a payment that can be verified in the blockchain.
	3. Eliminate intermediaries and reduce costs.
	4. Give the oportunity to pet lovers who work from home to generate an extra income.
	5. Create a token economy to incentive good behaivor in the platform.
